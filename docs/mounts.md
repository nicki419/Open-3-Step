### 3D-Printed Mounts

I have included my 3D-printed mounts for all the PCBs in use in this repository. 
They include screwholes at the bottom to screw them into wood. 
I have done this because I will carve out parts of the wooden frame of my lamp to mount these.

They have been created in OpenSCAD, so it should be relatively easy to modify. 
If there's a release, you will find STL files in it. If not, just download openscad, open the files
and press F6 to render and F7 to export.

Files starting with an underscore are modules. They are only used in other files, you do not need to open these.

Print the AC dimmer mount on its long side instead of its baseplate. I recommend giving it tree supports and a raft.

The RBDimmer module comes with an M2 version as well. That file also includes the washers needed to mount it with M2 screws.
